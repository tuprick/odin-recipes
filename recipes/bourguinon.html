    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A rich and hearty beef stew, perfect for cold winter days. This stew is delicious as-written, but if made in advance and allowed to simmer all day, the flavors become more complex and delicious. I like to serve this bourguinon over a pile of mashed potatoes.</p>

    <ul>Ingredients (stew):
        <li>1/4 lb bacon or lardon</li>
        <li>3 T olive oil</li>
        <li>3 lb stewing beef</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, mashed</li>
        <li>1/2 t fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
        <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 T flour</li>
        <li>1 T tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 c red wine</li>
        <li>2-3 c beef stock</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>Ingredients (garnish):
        <li>1 lb pearl onions, peeled</li>
        <li>1 lb mushrooms, halved</li>
        <li>3 1/2 T butter</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>Recipe:
        <li>Cut bacon into lardons. Cook in dutch oven for ~10 minutes until cooked, but not very crispy. While bacon is cooking, cut beef chuck into 1 1/2 inch cubes, trimmed of most fat.</li>
        <li>Add oil to rendered bacon fat and heat dutch oven just until oil starts to smoke. Add beef chunks, leaving room between them, and brown thoroughly on all sides. May need multiple batches. Set browned beef aside with bacon.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add diced vegetables and cook until translucent, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Return bacon and beef to pot, mix well, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sprinkly with flour and mix everything to coat. Add tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add in red wine and beef stock, adding enough stock to fully cover meat and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Transfer dutch oven to oven at 350 degrees or leave on stovetop at low heat. Cook for 3 1/2 to 4 hours at a gentle simmer</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>Just before serving:
        <li>Boil a small pot of water and add unpeeled pearl onions. When onions float to the top, remove with a slotted spoon and peel once cooled.</li>
        <li>Half or quarter mushrooms, depending on size. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add butter.</li>
        <li>Add peeled onions to skillet, tossing frequently until they begin to brown. Add mushrooms and pinch of sugar. Continue tossing in skillet until mushrooms sweat and brown. Set sauteed mushroom/onion mixture aside.</li>
        <li>Finely chop some italian parsely for garnish.</li>
        <li>Serve stew, topping with mushrooms, onions, parsely, and any reserved bacon bits from earlier.</li>
    </ol>
